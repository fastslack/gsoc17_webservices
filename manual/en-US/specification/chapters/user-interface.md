## User Interface
### New webservices Component
There will likely be a user interface required to control options. There needs
to be ways to turn on or off the entire webservice (it should give a 403), there
needs to be ways to easily control routes (for example not all websites will
want API options on all the potential options of an extension). Some websites
will want to control the access levels.

### Users integration
Some websites will want to be able to control access and refresh tokens for
users (although this latter information might be integrated with the existing
com_users component).
